This is the puzzle of December 11, 2021 of the Advent Of Code solved with the Commodore 64 in Basic. This program earned earned me my 21st and 22nd star :-)

The puzzle is here: https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11

Be patient, because the program runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes to solve both parts of the puzzle.

Have fun.
